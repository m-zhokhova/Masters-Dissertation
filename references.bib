  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exploded onto the machine learning scene in recent years owing to their capability to model and learn from graph-structured data. Such an ability has strong implications in a wide variety of fields whose data are inherently relational, for which conventional neural networks do not perform well. Indeed, as recent reviews can attest, research in the area of GNNs has grown rapidly and has lead to the development of a variety of GNN algorithm variants as well as to the exploration of ground-breaking applications in chemistry, neurology, electronics, or communication networks, among others. At the current stage research, however, the efficient processing of GNNs is still an open challenge for several reasons. Besides of their novelty, GNNs are hard to compute due to their dependence on the input graph, their combination of dense and very sparse operations, or the need to scale to huge graphs in some applications. In this context, this article aims to make two main contributions. On the one hand, a review of the field of GNNs is presented from the perspective of computing. This includes a brief tutorial on the GNN fundamentals, an overview of the evolution of the field in the last decade, and a summary of operations carried out in the multiple phases of different GNN algorithm variants. On the other hand, an in-depth analysis of current software and hardware acceleration schemes is provided, from which a hardware-software, graph-aware, and communication-centric vision for GNN accelerators is distilled.},

  abstract = {The problem of gene regulatory network inference is a major concern of systems biology. In recent years, a novel methodology has gained momentum, called community network approach. Community networks integrate predictions from individual methods in a ``metapredictor,'' in order to compose the advantages of different methods and soften individual limitations. This article proposes a novel methodology to integrate prediction ensembles using constraint programming , a declarative modeling and problem solving paradigm. Constraint programming naturally allows the modeling of dependencies among components of the problem as constraints, facilitating the integration and use of different forms of knowledge.

  abstract = {The problem of               gene regulatory network inference               is a major concern of systems biology. In recent years, a novel methodology has gained momentum, called               community network               approach. Community networks integrate predictions from individual methods in a ``metapredictor,'' in order to compose the advantages of different methods and soften individual limitations. This article proposes a novel methodology to integrate prediction ensembles using               constraint programming               , a declarative modeling and problem solving paradigm. Constraint programming naturally allows the modeling of dependencies among components of the problem as constraints, facilitating the integration and use of different forms of knowledge. The new paradigm, referred to as               constrained community network               , uses constraints to capture properties of the regulatory networks (e.g., topological properties) and to guide the integration of knowledge derived from different families of network predictions.

  abstract = {The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression profiles has been a key issue in systems biology, prompting many researchers to develop diverse computational methods. However, most of these methods do not reconstruct directed GRNs with regulatory types because of the lack of benchmark datasets or defects in the computational methods. Here, we collect benchmark datasets and propose a deep learning-based model, DeepFGRN, for reconstructing fine gene regulatory networks (FGRNs) with both regulation types and directions. In addition, the GRNs of real species are always large graphs with direction and high sparsity, which impede the advancement of GRN inference. Therefore, DeepFGRN builds a node bidirectional representation module to capture the directed graph embedding representation of the GRN. Specifically, the source and target generators are designed to learn the lowdimensional dense embedding of the source and target neighbors of a gene, respectively. An adversarial learning strategy is applied to iteratively learn the real neighbors of each gene. In addition, because the expression profiles of genes with regulatory associations are correlative, a correlation analysis module is designed. Specifically, this module not only fully extracts gene expression features, but also captures the correlation between regulators and target genes. Experimental results show that DeepFGRN has a competitive capability for both GRN and FGRN inference. Potential biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for breast cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 are identified based on the candidate FGRNs, providing a possible opportunity to advance our knowledge of disease treatments.},

Recently, various deep learning-based repurposing methods have been established to identify the potential drug-disease associations (DDA). However, effective utilization of the relations of biological entities to capture the biological interactions to enhance the drug-disease association prediction is still challenging. To resolve the above problem, we proposed a heterogeneous graph neural network called REDDA (Relations-Enhanced Drug-Disease Association prediction). Assembled with three attention mechanisms, REDDA can sequentially learn drug/disease representations by a general heterogeneous graph convolutional network-based node embedding block, a topological subnet embedding block, a graph attention block, and a layer attention block. Performance comparisons on our proposed benchmark dataset show that REDDA outperforms 8 advanced drug-disease association prediction methods, achieving relative improvements of 0.76\% on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score and 13.92\% on the precision-recall curve (AUPR) score compared to the suboptimal method. On the other benchmark dataset, REDDA also obtains relative improvements of 2.48\% on the AUC score and 4.93\% on the AUPR score. Specifically, case studies also indicate that REDDA can give valid predictions for the discovery of -new indications for drugs and new therapies for diseases.

Genotype-based prediction of the phenotype is thus a key challenge for the early diagnosis of AD. Machine learning techniques that have been proposed to address this challenge do not consider known biological interactions between the genes used as input features, thus neglecting important information about the disease mechanisms at play. To mitigate this, we first extracted AD subnetworks from several protein--protein interaction (PPI) databases and labeled these with genotype information (number of missense variants) to make them patient-specific. Next, we trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the patient-specific networks for phenotype prediction. We tested different PPI databases and compared the performance of the GNN models to baseline models using classical machine learning techniques, as well as randomized networks and input datasets. The overall results showed that GNNs could not outperform a baseline predictor only using the APOE gene, suggesting that missense variants are not sufficient to explain disease risk beyond the APOE status. Nevertheless, our results show that GNNs outperformed other machine learning techniques and that protein--protein interactions lead to superior results compared to randomized networks. These findings highlight that gene interactions are a valuable source of information in predicting disease status.},

Existing studies fulfil this requirement by employing machine learning techniques based on patient features, but they suffer from high dimensional data problems and a high level of bias. We propose a framework for predicting chronic disease based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address these issues. We begin by projecting a patient-disease bipartite graph to create a weighted patient network (WPN) that extracts the latent relationship among patients. We then use GNN-based techniques to build prediction models. These models use features extracted from WPN to create robust patient representations for chronic disease prediction. We compare the output of GNN-based models to machine learning methods by using cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disease. The results show that our framework enhances the accuracy of chronic disease prediction. The model with attention mechanisms achieves an accuracy of 93.49\% for cardiovascular disease prediction and 89.15\% for chronic pulmonary disease prediction. Furthermore, the visualisation of the last hidden layers of GNN-based models shows the pattern for the two cohorts, demonstrating the discriminative strength of the framework. The proposed framework can help stakeholders improve health management systems for patients at risk of developing chronic diseases and conditions.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the complexities of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for understanding cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Traditional computational methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of these networks. This study explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a powerful approach for modeling graph-structured data like GRNs. Utilizing a Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2), our study presents a novel approach to the construction and interrogation of GRNs, informed by gene expression data and Boolean models derived from literature. The model's adeptness in accurately predicting regulatory interactions and pinpointing key regulators is attributed to advanced attention mechanisms, a hallmark of the GNN framework. These insights suggest that GNNs are primed to revolutionize GRN analysis, addressing traditional limitations and offering richer biological insights. The success of GNNs, as highlighted by our model's reliance on high-quality data, calls for enhanced data collection methods to sustain progress. The integration of GNNs in GRN research is set to pioneer developments in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and our grasp of biological systems, bolstered by the structural analysis of networks for improved node and edge prediction.},

Due to the expensive and time-consuming methods verified by biological experiments, prediction methods based on computational models have gradually become an important means of lncRNA-disease associations discovery.

In this study, we propose a novel method called HGNNLDA for lncRNA-disease association prediction. First, HGNNLDA constructs a heterogeneous network composed of lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-disease association network and lncRNA-miRNA association network; Then, on this heterogeneous network, various types of strong correlation neighbors with fixed size are sampled for each node by restart random walk; Next, the embedding information of lncRNA and disease in each lncRNA-disease association pair is obtained by the method of type-based neighbor aggregation and all types combination though heterogeneous graph neural network, in which attention mechanism is introduced considering that different types of neighbors will make different contributions to the prediction of lncRNA-disease association. As a result, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) under fivefold cross-validation (5FCV) are 0.9786 and 0.8891, respectively. Compared with five state-of-art prediction models, HGNNLDA has better prediction performance. In addition, in two types of case studies, it is further verified that our method can effectively predict the potential lncRNA-disease associations, and have ability to predict new diseases without any known lncRNAs.},

It plays an important role in maintaining human life, body growth and reproduction. More and more researchers have shown that the concentrations of some metabolites in patients are different from those in healthy people. Traditional biological experiments can test some hypotheses and verify their relationships but usually take a considerable amount of time and money. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new computational method to identify the relationships between metabolites and diseases. In this work, we present a new deep learning algorithm named as graph convolutional network with graph attention network (GCNAT) to predict the potential associations of disease-related metabolites. First, we construct a heterogeneous network based on known metabolite--disease associations, metabolite--metabolite similarities and disease--disease similarities. Metabolite and disease features are encoded and learned through the graph convolutional neural network. Then, a graph attention layer is used to combine the embeddings of multiple convolutional layers, and the corresponding attention coefficients are calculated to assign different weights to the embeddings of each layer. Further, the prediction result is obtained by decoding and scoring the final synthetic embeddings. Finally, GCNAT achieves a reliable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and the precision-recall curve of 0.405, which are better than the results of existing five state-of-the-art predictive methods in 5-fold cross-validation, and the case studies show that the metabolite--disease correlations predicted by our method can be successfully demonstrated by relevant experiments.

  abstract = {With the increasingly available electronic medical records (EMRs), disease prediction has recently gained immense research attention, where an accurate classifier needs to be trained to map the input prediction signals (e.g., symptoms, patient demographics, etc.) to the estimated diseases for each patient. However, existing machine learning-based solutions heavily rely on abundant manually labeled EMR training data to ensure satisfactory prediction results, impeding their performance in the existence of rare diseases that are subject to severe data scarcity. For each rare disease, the limited EMR data can hardly offer sufficient information for a model to correctly distinguish its identity from other diseases with similar clinical symptoms. Furthermore, most existing disease prediction approaches are based on the sequential EMRs collected for every patient and are unable to handle new patients without historical EMRs, reducing their real-life practicality. In this paper, we introduce an innovative model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for disease prediction, which utilizes external knowledge bases to augment the insufficient EMR data, and learns highly representative node embeddings for patients, diseases and symptoms from the medical concept graph and patient record graph respectively constructed from the medical knowledge base and EMRs. By aggregating information from directly connected neighbor nodes, the proposed neural graph encoder can effectively generate embeddings that capture knowledge from both data sources, and is able to inductively infer the embeddings for a new patient based on the symptoms reported in her/his EMRs to allow for accurate prediction on both general diseases and rare diseases. Extensive experiments on a real-world EMR dataset have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model.},

  abstract = {With the increasingly available electronic medical records (EMRs), disease prediction has recently gained immense research attention, where an accurate classifier needs to be trained to map the input prediction signals (e.g., symptoms, patient demographics, etc.) to the estimated diseases for each patient. However, existing machine learning-based solutions heavily rely on abundant manually labeled EMR training data to ensure satisfactory prediction results, impeding their performance in the existence of rare diseases that are subject to severe data scarcity. For each rare disease, the limited EMR data can hardly offer sufficient information for a model to correctly distinguish its identity from other diseases with similar clinical symptoms. Furthermore, most existing disease prediction approaches are based on the sequential EMRs collected for every patient and are unable to handle new patients without historical EMRs, reducing their real-life practicality. In this paper, we introduce an innovative model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for disease prediction, which utilizes external knowledge bases to augment the insufficient EMR data, and learns highly representative node embeddings for patients, diseases and symptoms from the medical concept graph and patient record graph respectively constructed from the medical knowledge base and EMRs. By aggregating information from directly connected neighbor nodes, the proposed neural graph encoder can effectively generate embeddings that capture knowledge from both data sources, and is able to inductively infer the embeddings for a new patient based on the symptoms reported in her/his EMRs to allow for accurate prediction on both general diseases and rare diseases. Extensive experiments on a real-world EMR dataset have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model.},

  abstract = {The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.},

By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

Various outstanding network reconstruction algorithms use specific assumptions that affect prediction accuracy, in order to deal with the uncertainty of processing.

Various outstanding network reconstruction algorithms use specific assumptions that affect prediction accuracy, in order to deal with the uncertainty of processing. In order to study why a certain method is more suitable for specific research problem or experimental data, we conduct research from model-based, information-based and machine learning-based method classifications. There are obviously different types of computational tools that can be generated to distinguish GRNs. Furthermore, we discuss several classical, representative and latest methods in each category to analyze core ideas, general steps, characteristics, etc. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art GRN reconstruction technologies on simulated networks and real networks under different scaling conditions. Through standardized performance metrics and common benchmarks, we quantitatively evaluate the stability of various methods and the sensitivity of the same algorithm applying to different scaling networks. The aim of this study is to explore the most appropriate method for a specific GRN, which helps biologists and medical scientists in discovering potential drug targets and identifying cancer biomarkers.},

  abstract = {With the development of data science, more and more machine learning technologies have been designed to solve complicated and challenging real-world tasks containing a large volume of data. And many significant real-world datasets contain data in the form of networks or graphs. Graph Neural Networks is one of the powerful machine learning tools, which could provide a perfect solution to processing a large amount of non-Euclidean data. And because most bio information data in bioinformatics is in the non-Euclidean domain, Graph Neural Networks could then directly be applied to solve problems in bioinformatics. Much research has been done in the field of GNN, and there are also some surveys (Zhang et al., 2021a) related to GNN and its applications. However, there has been little research focusing on GNN in bioinformatics, and we think in the future we could better utilize GNN in the field of biology, so we would like to write a literature review to help take a comprehensive look at GNN and their applications in the field of bioinformatics. In this paper, we would first introduce SOTA models in Graph Neural Networks, and second, introduce their applications in bio information. And then we would provide future directions of Graph Neural Networks in bioinformatics.},
